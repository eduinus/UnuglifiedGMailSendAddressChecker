# UnuglifiedGMailSendAddressChecker
Before sending e-mail, check From, To, Cc, Bcc, subject, and attached files to prevent erroneous transmission
(But less ugly)

I stumbled upon this extension at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmailsend-address-checker/gdckkpniogfhndklmlgbnolnkbceeofp?hl=en-US as I was trying to find a solution for the problem of always accidentally sending emails from the wrong address. This extension does that nicely! But it looked really gross, so I changed the CSS and javascript accordingly.

To install, download, go to chrome extensions, enable developer mode, and click "load unpacked." Navigate to the downloaded "0.23.3_0" directory, and select that folder. Your extension should now be installed.
